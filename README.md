# 💸 Send App – UI/UX Design Case Study

I worked on this project as a **UI/UX Designer**, using **Figma** as the primary design tool.

**Send App** is a cross-currency transfer and crypto conversion app that allows users to:
- Send money in any currency
- Convert between fiat and cryptocurrencies
- Navigate a seamless, clean, and user-friendly experience

### 👩🏽‍🎨 My Role:
- UI/UX Design
- Wireframing & Prototyping
- Logo Design
- Visual Layout & Branding

My focus was on creating an interface that felt **simple, responsive, and easy to navigate**, especially for users unfamiliar with crypto platforms. This project allowed me to deepen my design thinking skills and improve my ability to structure user flows effectively.

> 🔧 **Tools Used**: Figma
